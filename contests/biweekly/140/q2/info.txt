Q2. Maximize the Total Height of Unique Towers

You are given an array maximumHeight, where maximumHeight[i] 
denotes the max height the ith tower can be assigned.

Your task is to assign a height to each tower so that:
1. the height of the 4th tower is a positive integer and does not exceed maximumHeight[I]
2. no two towers have the same height

Return the maximum possible total sum of the tower heights. If its not possible to assign heights, return -1

Example 1:
    Input: maximumHeight = [2, 3, 4, 3]
    Output: 10
    Explanation:
        We can assign heights in the following way: [1, 2, 4, 3].

Example 2:
    Input: maximumHeight = [15, 10]
    Output: -1
    Explanation:
        It's impossible to assign positive heights to each index so that no two towers have the same height
        
Constraints:

1 <= maximumHeight.lengthÂ <= 105
1 <= maximumHeight[i] <= 109
